# Polka

This theme adds some colorful minimalism to Obsidian in light and dark modes, with characteristic dots in the ribbon. Major features include a fully customizable color scheme and independent selection of themes for code blocks.

## Accent Color Customization

Polka responds to the accent color in your main settings (under `Appearance > Accent color`) by using it for links, highlights, the dots in the ribbon and much else besides. For example, if you choose a pink accent color while in dark mode, the default cyan will be replaced in all the ways you can see below (and more):

If you prefer text highlights to use a traditional yellow background regardless of your accent color, you can switch this on with style settings.

## Background Color Customization

With the style settings plugin, you can access sliders for the hue, saturation and lightness of the background color palette, giving you full control over the color scheme. As well as letting you choose the base color for a whole palette that retains cohesion across the interface, you can also alter the contrast between primary and secondary background colors.

## Code Block Customization

## Fonts

Font taste is personal. Polka selects nice default fonts for Mac and PC but your main font settings (under `Appearance > Font`) will override these.

The style settings plugin provides a toggle to use your default monospace font in tables, which can be useful for numeric content that doesn't suit all body fonts.

The font in the preview images is Franklin Gothic, which is distributed with Windows. If you want a good, free alternative, try [Rubik](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Rubik).

## Plugin Support

As well as modifying your workspace, Polka adapts the colors of Obsidian's user interface and the whole suite of core plugins. Additionally, code syntax highlighting uses the built-in color scheme but the hues have been refined.

Special attention has been given to the following community plugins:

- [Calendar](https://github.com/liamcain/obsidian-calendar-plugin)
- [Dictionary](https://github.com/phibr0/obsidian-dictionary)
- [Execute Code](https://github.com/twibiral/obsidian-execute-code)
- [File Tree Alternative](https://github.com/ozntel/file-tree-alternative)
- [Kanban](https://github.com/mgmeyers/obsidian-kanban)

Many others will fit in without issue but [let me know](https://github.com/callumhackett/obsidian_polka_theme/issues) if you think I should support something else.
