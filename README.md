# Polka

This theme adds some colorful minimalism to Obsidian in light and dark modes, with characteristic dots in the ribbon. Major features include a **highly customizable color scheme** and independent selection of **sub-themes for code blocks**.

## Customization

### Accents

Polka responds to the accent color in your main settings (under `Appearance > Accent color`) by using it for links, highlights, the dots in the ribbon and much else besides. For example, if you choose a pink accent color while in dark mode, the default cyan will be replaced in all the ways you can see below (and more):

### Backgrounds

If you install the [Style Settings](https://github.com/mgmeyers/obsidian-style-settings) plugin, a new menu will appear (in `Style Settings > Polka Theme`) that allows you to customize the background color palette, with independent settings for light and dark modes.

You can easily adjust the hue, saturation, lightness and contrast of the background colors, and you don't have to worry about color clashes, as your base color is used to generate a palette that applies to the whole user interface. Here are some examples of customizations that took around ten seconds to dial in:

### Code Blocks

The Style Settings menu also features a list of sub-themes that apply exclusively to code blocks. Polka has nicely contrastive default colors for syntax highlighting but you can switch to popular schemes like Dracula, Gruvbox, Nord, One Dark and Solarized.

### Fonts

Font taste is personal. Polka selects nice default fonts for Mac and PC but your main font settings (under `Appearance > Font`) will override these.

The body font in the preview images here is Franklin Gothic, which is distributed with Windows. If you want a good, free alternative, try [Rubik](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Rubik). The code font in the sub-theme previews above is [iA Writer Mono](https://github.com/iaolo/iA-Fonts/tree/master/iA%20Writer%20Mono), a derivative of [IBM Plex Mono](https://github.com/IBM/plex) with small character adjustments.

### Additional Options

The Style Settings plugin also gives you control over the following parameters:

- Main text color
- Accent color vs. traditional yellow highlights
- Circular vs. square checkboxes
- Default vs. monospace font in tables
- Roundness of page elements and menus

## Plugin Support

As well as modifying your workspace, Polka adapts the colors of Obsidian's user interface and the whole suite of core plugins. Additional attention has been given to the following community plugins:

- [Calendar](https://github.com/liamcain/obsidian-calendar-plugin)
- [Dictionary](https://github.com/phibr0/obsidian-dictionary)
- [Execute Code](https://github.com/twibiral/obsidian-execute-code)
- [File Tree Alternative](https://github.com/ozntel/file-tree-alternative)
- [Kanban](https://github.com/mgmeyers/obsidian-kanban)

Many others will fit in without issue.

## Feature Requests

[Let me know](https://github.com/callumhackett/obsidian_polka_theme/issues) if you spot any issues or would like extra features, especially new plugin support or code block themes.

Polka tries to strike a balance between colorful minimalism, simplicity of use and customizability, so its options menu is meant to give you flexibility but not total control. If you're looking to tweak things like heading styles or the relationship between primary and secondary background colors, I recommend that you [create your own CSS snippets](https://help.obsidian.md/Extending+Obsidian/CSS+snippets) but I'm always happy to hear suggestions.
